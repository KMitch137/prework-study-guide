## Usage

A user should referance this guide while in the early stages of thier learning to make sure they haev a solid grasp on the core concepts of each topic. I will add to the items as I progress through my learning to keep this as up-to-date as I can so that it will remain usefull. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
