        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. </li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet, this is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>Dont forgert to link to the external style sheet</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The "." preceding "card" designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class "card" will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
